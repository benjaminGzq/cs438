I implement a PGPS scheduler by using the lecture slides (http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/lam/386p/slides/Packet_Scheduling_algorithms.pdf)
& the paper provided: Generalized Processor Sharing Approach to Flow Control in Integrated Services Networks: The Single-Node Case (http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx4/90/6050/00234856.pdf?tp=&arnumber=234856&isnumber=6050)
to figure out how to assign virtual times to the packets which are parsed from the input file and assigned to structs.

To simulate the actual scheduler, I implemented a loop where the counter represents the real time.
To schedule a packet, it traverses the list of packet structs, seeing which have arrived by a given real time, & then finds the minimal vtime.
The packet with the minimal vtime gets "processed" and our counter gets incremented by its size.

If there is idle time, no packet with a minimal vtime should be found so I just incrememnt the counter by one & try again.
